This is just a small text that I've made, containing information about how I collected the rocks that are needed for the Trimmed Completionist Cape.
The requirements are called: 'Who Will Be Her Lover?' & 'Stone's Throw Away'. 

The information in this text won't provide you with most efficient way to obtain the rocks as fast as possible. 
I'm 100% sure there are better/faster methods out there. This is just a general guideline for how I approached these requirements.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Optional: Wear your Silverhawk Boots as much as possible.
- Optional: Use your skilling items/outfits.

- Mandatory: Whenever a Strange rock is acquired in a certain skill X. Make sure that you always switch to skill Y. This is due to the fact that the chance to obtain a second rock in skill X is always severely reduced, so never go for two rocks in a row in the same skill!

- G = Golden Rock.
- S = Strange Rock.
- W84 = Teleport to Lumbridge nd use the Portables by the bank (chest) nearby.
